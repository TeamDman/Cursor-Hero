# Current Priorities

## Active

- fix mouse captive in gamepad input mode
  - planned resolution: detect hardware mouse movements to trigger mnk mode

## Up Next

- fix r3 position cursor at title bar


## Grab Bag

- add world representation of all our cursor_hero crates where clicking them will toggle their log level to warn
- rustdoc_json to create buttons to toggle log level for individual crates from within the game, persisting changes by modifying the log plugin init code 
- window swap: swap the position of the game window with the window under the cursor
- switch LLM to one that is better for programming and knows about VS Code.
- Keyboard Tool D-Pad Chords for Arbitrary Letters
- Understand why I can't use the app to hit its own close button

- home and end buttons in keyboard tool

- data brick - screenshot tool creates physics object cube that contains the data
  - only show hover preview and only process clicks for ui elements that match a known data provider pattern
  - agent can manipulate and observe the cube
  - cube observations do not map to the inner info, apps may be summarized in a few lines with hints about what subdata can be extracted
  - UI databrick - contains information extracted from UI Automation
  - File databrick - contains file contents and file handle info (path, size, etc)
  - Chat databrick - contains chat history
  - brick observations shouldn't be retained from previous messages, only keep chat history / purge brick history? if the agent can only observe the bricks around it, and we create a brick to represent chat history, then we can have the agent manage its own context window by summarizing and discarding bricks. problem: how large is the context window? we need indicators. Not contained within, but referenced to be gathered later.

heuristics!

add a binding to the voice tool for hitting the enter button.Add a binding.for the Ctrl-S hotkey.add a hotkey to thefor inserting a new line.Add a camera tool to own the hotkey for fire.following the character.- tool selection wheel show on rstick click, left stick to pick item in the wheel - is the toolbelt a tool?
- teleport tool - rstick in maps left stick to full screen coords. Full left stick places cursor as far left, across all screens, as possible
- find way to overlay on top of other windows without drawing the screens
- text buffer - a change-listenable history-queryable place to store text
- d-pad keyboard navigation tool , arrow keys, wasd, hjkl
- clipboard tool - keybind to push text buffer to system clipboard, keybind to pull from system clipboard to text buffer, keybind to send ctrl+v input
- voice2text tool - hold to talk to transcribe your voice into the text buffer
- annotation tool - keybind to append to a file (timestamp, cursor pos, element under cursor persistent id, text buffer)
- cursor tool - mapping to shift to enable shift-clicking, mapping control to enable control clicking.Combinable with shift.
- summarize tool - summarize the clicked element. north/south: summary length adjust. east/west: level of detail adjust
- dump tool - poop emoji icon, dumps context of the current timestep to the text buffer. keybind to adjust detail

- TTS (glados)
- more real time voice 2 text
- indicator out of bounds when OBS is not recording / status lights for OBS
- detect periods of waiting and replace progress spinners / cargo build logs / chatgpt still typing a response with a video from my watch later, my move in a chess game, a chess puzzle, an email -- predict the length of the time spinning to pick a thing to that will take that amount of time, 
- point at program and open the source code - mapping from program to disk location
- automate bevy cloning and dependency update to point at local clones of the repos

# use case

select multiple files from vscode, tool read the contents of those files and format in markdown code blocks including file path 

```main.rs
pub mod other;

fn main() {
    println!("hello world");
}
```

```other.rs
pub fn other() {
    println!("other");
}
```

to be combined in non-conflicting keys

- left click
- enter
- voice2text
- copy to clipboard
- append to selection
- remove from selection

# use case - slider hub

volume slider hub

Master slider
Audio mixer slider per app
