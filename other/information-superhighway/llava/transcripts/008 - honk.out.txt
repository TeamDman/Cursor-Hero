 The image shows two panels with a humorous take on drawing. In the first panel, there is a blank white space where an audience member is presumably trying to draw a duck and share their art. On the second panel, there is a cartoon depiction of an artist's ego, which looks like a muscular, human-like figure with wings, sitting next to a drawing of a duck with a speech bubble saying "HONK!". The second panel also shows another duck with a speech bubble that reads "DRAW A DUCK AND SHARE YOUR ART", indicating the artist's response or challenge to others. The image is meant to be funny by exaggerating the ego of an artist who creates their own representation of a common subject, seemingly mocking the efforts of others to share their own artwork.
