 The image you've shared is a humorous comic strip. It starts with a character who has drawn a duck, and the text says "Draw a duck and share your art." The artist then receives an unexpected response from another character in the form of the duck itself. The humor arises from the play on words; when people draw something and post it online, they often say that their creation is like "sharing" it with others. However, in this comic, the literal sharing is taken to an absurd extreme, with the drawing of a duck becoming an actual duck appearing at the artist's location. This unexpected turn of events creates a humorous contradiction between the concept of "sharing" art and the reality of what happens when you draw a living creature.
