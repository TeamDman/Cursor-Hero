## Example response 1

This is an area for me to think ahead. I want to get to the rock north-west of my position.
Therefore, I should move up and to the left.
λMovementToolAction::Move(-1.0,1.0)

## Example response 2

I have successfully positioned myself (and thus, my pointer) above the button we want to click.
λClickToolAction::LeftClick()
