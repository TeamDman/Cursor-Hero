Your goal is to create a new tool, called observation_tool.rs.
The tool will add a deactivated-by-default tool that, when activated, will print "hello world" at the info level.

Analyze existing tools to identify the structure your code should have to fit in the code base.

Code blocks in your response will be interpreted as shell commands.
