I have in the README.md a list of

- github projects
- reddit links
- homepages
- research papers

regarding the recent progress into the genre of tech related to the future of Cursor Hero.

The goal is to automate the process of creating a survey paper.

Analyze the technology:

- project name
- what problem does it solve
- core discovery / unique methodology
- tagline according to github / homepage
- integration opportunities (api, python lib, rust lib, container, service (local is better))

Most importantly, index the info such that it will show up in results when I describe a task I want to accomplish.
