I am recording in OBS. I am using VSCode.
I have ChatGPT open. 
So I'm talking and describing the problem that I want solved.And I'm gesturing in the editor, but ChatGPT cannot see the gestures at this time.Currently the best I can do is hold a push-to-talk button that will transcribe things as I say them, but that is not capturing information such as the selection under my mouse changing or tabs being changed in VS Code.One thing that I think would be good is a visual feedback for when the push-to-talk is actively listening.and that won't give misinformation. So if it says it's listening, it must be accurate.Because you can't be second-guessing the indicatorThe current best indicator is focusing the Windows Terminal, which has multiple tabs open, but one of those tabs is the Python program, which does have logging for when it is listening and other activities.So this could be leveraged.One possible way to do it would be to havethe tool programmatically focus the Windows Terminal window and then grab the content inside of it.a different way to do it would be to have the startup script for the thing that is running theWindows, or the voice-to-text thing.The thing that launches that would do so in a way that it captures the system and feeds it back to our program.One way to grab the logs would be to focus the Windows terminal, programmatically click and drag from the top left to the bottom right to select all the content, and then right-click to copy it.This causes problems though because the scenario where we are using the push-to-talk might be where we have something focused and we expect to type the response into it, but the act of focusing the Windows terminal to capture the content of it using click-and-drag would unfocus the text box we were previously at.That could be remediated by placing a marker fora reference on how to return to the current state.so that when we deviate from the state to analyze something, we know how to return to it. So the act of focusing the Windows terminal and unfocusing the text input, we would need to be able to...have a course of action for refocusing the text input. I need a way to be able to toggle the listening instead of holding it, because if I'm talking for a long time, I might just want it to listen continuously without having to hold down a button. and want to make a tool for the clipboard. It will be called the clipboard tool. The clipboard tool, when equipped, will...disable all the other tools so that it is the last one. So instead of adding to my to-do list an item that I could finish now but want to put on hold to pursue a different idea, it is just better for me to finish it.

# Get the list of all Cargo.toml files
cargo_files = []
for root, dirs, files in os.walk('./crates'):
    for file in files:
        if file == 'Cargo.toml':
            cargo_files.append(os.path.join(root, file))

# Iterate over each Cargo.toml file
for cargo_file in cargo_files:
    with open(cargo_file, 'r') as file:
        lines = file.readlines()

    # Find entries in [dependencies] that don't begin with "cursor_"
    dependencies = []
    for i, line in enumerate(lines):
        if line.strip() == '[dependencies]':
            j = i + 1
            while j < len(lines) and not lines[j].startswith('['):
                dependency = lines[j].strip()
                if not dependency.startswith('cursor_'):
                    dependencies.append(dependency)
                j += 1

    # Update the dependencies to { workspace = true }
    for i, dependency in enumerate(dependencies):
        lines[lines.index(dependency)] = dependency.replace(dependency, f'{dependency} = {{ workspace = true }}')

    # Append features block to the windows crate
    if 'windows' in cargo_file:
        for i, line in enumerate(lines):
            if line.strip() == '[dependencies.windows]':
                j = i + 1
                while j < len(lines) and not lines[j].startswith('['):
                    if lines[j].startswith('features'):
                        lines[j] = lines[j].strip()[:-1] + ', "abc"]\n'
                    j += 1

    # Log the replaced entries
    replaced_entries = [dependency.split('=')[0].strip() for dependency in dependencies]
    print(f'Replaced entries in {cargo_file}: {replaced_entries}')

    # Write the updated lines back to the Cargo.toml file
    # with open(cargo_file, 'w') as file:
    #     file.writelines(lines)
```
That is an attempt at a notebook to...adjust dependencies to rely on the parent create.
It doesn't print anything when ran.
