```rust
    log_behaviour: PointerLogBehaviour::Errors,
    // log_behaviour: PointerLogBehaviour::ErrorsAndPositionUpdates,
```
context action to swap which line is commented
- identify based on line matching except for different enum variant

or just suggest switching the variant, flag the variant as toggleable from IDE?
